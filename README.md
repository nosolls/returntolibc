# Return-to-libc Attack

## Demonstration of the Attack

The Return-to-libc Attack is a buffer-overflow vulnerability that gives the attacker root privelege on a system. The lab makes use of gdb and changing kernel settings to make this possible.

## Target Audience

### Teachers
If you are a teacher in cybersecurity or a field related to it, this is a good opportunity to give your students a hands-on experience in dealing with the Return-to-libc attack. They'll be able to see what security requirements must be changed for a hacker to gain root access and how to use gdb to get needed addresses.

### Students
If you are a student in cybersecurity or a field related to it, it's important to understand the layers of protection that go into preventing an attacker from gaining root access on a machine. This gives you experience with looking into how to remove these layers and making a machine vulnerable.
